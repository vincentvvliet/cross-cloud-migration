Consistency:
  Eventually consistent reads by default
  Strongly consistent reads available (single-region only)

Availability:
  3-way replication within an AZ; multi-region Global Tables for global availability

Durability:
  Multi-AZ synchronous replication

Ordering guarantees:
  Conditional writes provide last-write-wins semantics; no global ordering

Transaction guarantees:
  Optional serializable ACID transactions

Conflict resolution (multi-region):
  Synchronous multi-master replication with timestamp-based conflict resolution (LWW)
